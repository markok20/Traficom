Traficom vehicle data analysis

Traficom's open data: Finland will register these cars in 2021-2022!

What have been the most popular models and brands in Finland for first registrations from 2021? What are the most popular colors with the most popular brands? What were the most popular powertrains and transmissions? Which brand has the most electric hybrids in its collection? What are the average emissions for electric hybrids? And how much have emissions decreased on average since the mid-1990s?


I looked for answers to these questions when I went through the vehicle open data 5.13 material from Traficom's website. The open data of vehicles contains registration, approval and technical information of all vehicles in traffic from the register of traffic matters maintained by Traficom.


The data contained a total of 5,163,487 rows and was published on February 24, 2023. From the database, I only extracted data from passenger cars (vehicle classes M1 and M1G) and limited it to those registered for the first time since the beginning of 2021. I processed the data with Python.


What are the most popular brands? At the top are Toyota, Volvo and Mercedez-Benz.


What are the most popular models? The top three are models from Toyota, Tesa and Volvo. Finns prefer practicality when they put station wagons and multi-purpose vehicles at the top of the shopping list.


What are the most popular colors for the first registration? The tip of the three was white, gray and black.



What are the most popular drives? Rumors of the death of the internal combustion engine seem to be greatly exaggerated. Gasoline is strongly in pole position and diesel is coming second. More than 14 percent chose electric technology for their car.


What are the most popular transmissions? The automatic has replaced the traditional gearbox. Two out of three chose the automatic.


It was also interesting to know which brands have the most electric hybrids in their collections?


The development of combustion engine technology in cars is strongly reflected in the development of carbon dioxide emissions. Emissions have decreased drastically since the mid-1990s. Back in the mid-1990s, the average emissions were over 220, while now they are around 130 on average.

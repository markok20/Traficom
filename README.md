Traficom vehicle data analysis

Traficom's open data: Finland will register these cars in 2021-2022!

What have been the most popular models and brands in Finland for first registrations from 2021? What are the most popular colors with the most popular brands? What were the most popular engine powers and transmissions? Which brand has the most electric hybrids in its collection? What are the average emissions for electric hybrids? And how much have emissions decreased on average since the mid-1990s?


I looked for answers to these questions when I went through the vehicle open data from Traficom's website. The open data of vehicles contains registration, approval and technical information of all vehicles in traffic  by Traficom.


The data contained a total of 5,163,487 rows and was published on February 24, 2023. From the database, I only extracted data from passenger cars (vehicle classes M1 and M1G) and limited it to those registered for the first time since the beginning of 2021. I processed the data with Python.

I looked answwers for these questions:

What are the most popular brands?

What are the most popular models?

What are the most popular colors for the first registration?

What are the most popular engine powers?

What are the most popular transmissions?

It was also interesting to know which brands have the most electric hybrids in their fleet?

The development of engine technology in cars is strongly reflected in the development of carbon dioxide emissions. Emissions have decreased drastically since the mid-1990s. Back in the mid-1990s, the average emissions were over 220, while now they are around 130 on average.
